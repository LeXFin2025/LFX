${documentText}

Generate exactly 3 specific future risk predictions in JSON format, with each prediction having:
1. "title": A concise title for the risk (5-7 words)
2. "description": A detailed explanation (1-2 sentences) that mentions specific sections, clauses, or aspects of the document
3. "riskScore": A probability percentage between 1-100 that represents likelihood 
4. "impact": Either "Critical", "High", "Medium", or "Low"
5. "timeframe": When this risk will likely materialize (e.g., "Q2 2025")

Structure your response as valid JSON in the following format:

      "description": "...",
      "riskScore": 85,
